|                       protocols such as HTTP, DNS, FTP, and includes identifying file requests, decoding encoded content, and detecting anomalies.
|                    -- The analysis includes the answers for the questions provided.
|                    -- TOOLS USED: - Wireshark (for packet capture analysis)

               ## Overview
                    An interactive game where a needle swings between 0° and 180°. Players try to stop the needle as close to 90° as possible to score points, testing their timing and precision.
              ## Features
                    - Needle swings continuously between 0° and 180°.

                    - Maximum score (100) awarded for stopping exactly at 90°.
                    - Score decreases as the stopped angle moves away from 90°.
                    - Visuals include a strength meter arc and hammer image.
                    - Final score is shown after each attempt.
