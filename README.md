|        ##Objective -- This involves analyzing a packet capture (PCAP) file to understand the network traffic patterns, protocols involved, and potential suspicious behaviors. The analysis covers multiple 
|                       protocols such as HTTP, DNS, FTP, and includes identifying file requests, decoding encoded content, and detecting anomalies.
|                    -- The analysis includes the answers for the questions provided.
|                    -- TOOLS USED: - Wireshark (for packet capture analysis)
|                                  - Base64 Decoder (online or local tool)

|           ### Hammer Strength Test Game
|               ## Overview
|                    An interactive game where a needle swings between 0° and 180°. Players try to stop the needle as close to 90° as possible to score points, testing their timing and precision.
|              ## Features
|                    - Needle swings continuously between 0° and 180°.
|                    - Player stops the needle by clicking a button or pressing a key.
|                    - Maximum score (100) awarded for stopping exactly at 90°.
|                    - Score decreases as the stopped angle moves away from 90°.
|                    - Visuals include a strength meter arc and hammer image.
|                    - Final score is shown after each attempt.
|              ## How to Play
|                    1. Watch the needle swing back and forth.
|                    2. Press the stop button or key to halt the needle.
|                    3. Aim to stop it as close to 90° as possible.
|                    4. See your score based on accuracy.

          ### Vehicle Image Classification Using ResNet18
              ## Project Overview
                    This project classifies images of motor vehicles into 7 categories: Auto Rickshaws, Bikes, Cars, Motorcycles, Planes, Ships, and Trains. It uses a pre-trained ResNet18 model fine-tuned on the 
                    provided dataset to perform multi-class classification.
              ## Features
                   - Dataset contains curated images of 7 vehicle classes.
                   - Images are preprocessed with resizing, normalization, and tensor conversion.
                   - ResNet18 model from torchvision is modified to output 7 classes.
                   - Model trained using GPU acceleration on Google Colab.
                   - Training includes optimizer and loss function setup.
                   - Final loss and accuracy metrics reported.
                   - Sample predictions on one image per class are visualized with matplotlib.
